    "### KPI Update Callback Explanation\n",
    "This section describes the functionality of the callback function responsible for dynamically updating the KPI values in the HR Analytics Dashboard based on the selected year from the dropdown.\n",
    "1. **Callback Definition**:\n",
    "    - The callback is triggered when a value is selected in the `year-dropdown` component.\n",
    "    - It updates the children of the three KPI elements:\n",
    "        - **`kpi-avg-salary`**\n",
    "        - **`kpi-avg-satisfaction`**\n",
    "        - **`kpi-avg-absence`**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "    - The function first checks if a valid year is selected and whether the `Year` column exists in the dataset (`df`).\n",
    "    - If no year is selected or the `Year` column is missing, all KPI values are set to default: `\"No data\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Filtering**:\n",
    "    - The dataset (`df`) is filtered to include only rows where the `Year` matches the selected year.\n",
    "    - If the filtered data is empty, the KPIs are set to `\"No data\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **KPI Calculations**:\n",
    "    - **Average Salary**:\n",
    "The mean of the `Salary` column within the filtered data is calculated.\n",
    "    - **Average Satisfaction**:\n",
    "The mean of the `Satisfaction` column is calculated and formatted on a scale of 1 to 10.\n",
    "    - **Average Sick Days (Illness)**:\n",
    "        - Data is further filtered to include only rows where the `Absence Reason` is `\"Illness\"`.\n",
    "        - The mean of the `Absence Days` column is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Formatting**:\n",
    "    - The results for each KPI are formatted into user-friendly strings:\n",
    "        - Salary: Displayed in euros with two decimal places (e.g., `\"3450.55 €\"`).\n",
    "        - Satisfaction: Presented on a 10-point scale with two decimal places (e.g., `\"8.34 / 10\"`).\n",
    "        - Sick Days: Displayed in days with two decimal places (e.g., `\"5.21 days\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the calculated value is `NaN`, it is replaced with `\"No data\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Purpose**:\n",
    "    - This callback ensures that the dashboard dynamically reflects the data for the selected year, providing insights into key metrics such as salary, satisfaction, and absence trends.\n"

    "    - If any of these columns are missing, it raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "    - The `Hiring Date` and `Exit Date` columns are converted to datetime format for accurate filtering. Any invalid or missing dates are handled using the `errors=\"coerce\"` parameter.\n",

    "### Render Page 2 and Interactive Analysis Callback Explanation\n",
    "This section explains the functionality included in rendering the second page of the analytics dashboard and showcases interactive analysis through visualization updates in response to user input.\n",
    "#### **1. `render_page_2` Function**\n",
    "This function is responsible for rendering the layout of the second page of the dashboard. It includes the following components:\n",
    "1. **Scatterplot Visualization**:\n",
    "    - A scatter plot is created to show the relationship between **Salary** and **Satisfaction**, with the `Status` field used for color coding.\n",
    "    - The plot's attributes include:\n",
    "        - **X-Axis**: `Salary`.\n",
    "        - **Y-Axis**: `Satisfaction`.\n",
    "        - **Color**: Differentiates between employee `Status` (e.g., `\"Active\"`, `\"Retired\"`, `\"Left\"`) using a custom `color_discrete_map`.\n",
    "        - **Title**: `\"Satisfaction vs. Salary by Status\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Analysis Section**:\n",
    "    - A **Dropdown** (`dcc.Dropdown`) is provided to allow users to select a feature they want to analyze further.\n",
    "    - **Graph Placeholder**: An empty `dcc.Graph` component is used to display results dynamically based on the dropdown selection. It will be updated by the callback function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "This function creates a visually detailed and interactive page where users can explore relationships between employee satisfaction, salary, and selected features for further analysis.\n",
    "#### **2. `update_interactive_plot` Callback**\n",
    "This callback updates the content of the **interactive graph** based on the selected feature from the dropdown.\n",
    "**Functionality**:\n",
    "1. **Input Validation**:\n",
    "    - Checks whether the selected feature (`selected_feature`) exists in the dataframe (`df`).\n",
    "    - If the feature is invalid or missing, it returns an empty plot (`px.scatter`) with a title: `\"No valid data available\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Histogram Creation**:\n",
    "    - A histogram is generated using the selected feature:\n",
    "        - **X-Axis**: The feature chosen by the user (e.g., `Age`, `Salary`).\n",
    "        - **Y-Axis**: Frequency distribution of data, optionally normalized to **percent (`histnorm=\"percent\"`)**.\n",
    "        - **Color**: Groups data by `Status` for better comparative analysis.\n",
    "        - **Barmode**: Displays the histogram in **grouped mode**, which separates the data by `Status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The title is dynamically set as `\"Frequency Distribution: <Selected Feature>\"` for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "The returned histogram plot is displayed in the `dcc.Graph` component (`interactive-plot`) based on user interaction.\n",
    "### Features and Benefits Summary\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Provides insights into how employee **Satisfaction** correlates to **Salary**.\n",
    "    - Highlights differences based on employee status categories (e.g., \"Active\", \"Retired\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Dropdown-Controlled Visualization**:\n",
    "    - Allows flexible analysis by enabling users to select specific features (like `Age` or `Salary`) for detailed distribution exploration.\n",
    "    - Visualizes the data distribution for selected features grouped by employee `Status`, offering deeper comparative insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Interactivity**:\n",
    "    - By combining static plots with dropdown-driven dynamic updates, the page supports both general exploration and detailed, focused analysis tailored to user preferences.\n"

    "### Page 3: Correlation Matrix Visualization\n",
    "This section explains the functionality used to render the **Correlation Matrix** on the third page of the dashboard. It provides a clear and detailed view of the relationships between numerical features in the dataset while omitting irrelevant or redundant data (like self-correlations).\n",
    "#### **1. Render Correlation Matrix**\n",
    "The function `render_page_3_correlation_matrix` handles the creation and display of the Correlation Matrix. Below are its key features and steps:\n",
    "##### **Step 1: Filtering Numeric Columns**\n",
    "- The function begins by selecting only numeric columns from the dataset (`df`). This ensures the correlation matrix is calculated exclusively on features that support mathematical correlation.\n",
    "- **Validation**:\n",
    "    - If the dataset doesn't contain any numeric columns, the function returns a message informing the user that no correlation analysis is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2: Computing the Correlation Matrix**\n",
    "- The correlation matrix is calculated using the `.corr()` method, which provides pairwise correlation coefficients between numeric columns.\n",
    "- **Key Considerations**:\n",
    "    - High correlation values (close to +1 or -1) indicate strong positive or negative relationships, while values near 0 signify weak or no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3: Removing the Diagonal**\n",
    "- Since the diagonal of the matrix contains self-correlation values (always 1.0), these values are masked (hidden) using a NumPy identity matrix (`np.eye`). This improves visual clarity by emphasizing relationships between different columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4: Creating the Heatmap**\n",
    "- A high-resolution heatmap is generated using **Seaborn's `heatmap`** function:\n",
    "    - **Diagonal Removed**: Ensures focus is only on cross-variable relationships.\n",
    "    - **Colors**: A `\"coolwarm\"` colormap is used to distinguish strong correlations (positive in red, negative in blue).\n",
    "    - **Annotations**: Each correlation coefficient is displayed directly on the heatmap, rounded to two decimal places for readability.\n",
    "    - **Styling**:\n",
    "        - Font sizes are adjusted for axis labels and the plot title to enhance usability.\n",
    "        - The plot is square-shaped, with a color bar scaled for clarity (`shrink=0.6`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The figure is configured to a size of 20x20 inches with a DPI of 300 for high resolution, ensuring professional-looking output.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 5: Encoding the Heatmap**\n",
    "- The heatmap is saved as a PNG image into a `BytesIO` buffer.\n",
    "- The image is encoded using Base64, converting it into a format that can be directly displayed in the Dash app as an `<img>` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 6: Embedding the Heatmap in Dash**\n",
    "- The correlation matrix image is embedded in the layout of the page as an `<img>` tag:\n",
    "    - Fully responsive, scaled to fit the available screen space (`width: 100%`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Summary\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Validation**:\n",
    "    - Ensures end-users only see meaningful content. If the dataset has no numeric columns, an informative message is displayed instead of a heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Diagonal-Free Correlation Heatmap**:\n",
    "    - Self-correlations are removed, allowing users to focus on relationships between distinct features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High-Resolution Visualization**:\n",
    "    - Clear and professional heatmap generated using **Seaborn**, highlighting both positive and negative correlations with a visually appealing colormap.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dash Integration**:\n",
    "    - The heatmap is integrated seamlessly into the dashboard layout as a responsive image, offering a user-friendly and visually informative experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the Correlation Matrix\n",
    "The correlation matrix enables users to:\n",
    "- Detect and quantify linear relationships between numerical features.\n",
    "- Identify features with the strongest or weakest correlations.\n",
    "- Explore patterns that can guide further statistical modeling or decision-making."

    "### **2. File Upload and Processing Callbacks**\n",
    "#### **Callback 1: File Upload Feedback**\n",
    "This callback provides user-friendly feedback for the file upload process.\n",
    "**Functionality**:\n",
    "- Listens for any uploaded file (`contents`) along with the filename.\n",
    "- Validates the file type and parses the content if it is a valid `.csv` file.\n",
    "- Feedback messages include:\n",
    "    - **Success**: Confirms the file was uploaded successfully.\n",
    "    - **Invalid File Type**: Informs the user that only `.csv` files are allowed.\n",
    "    - **Error**: Displays any issues encountered during file processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Callback 2: Process and Display Data**\n",
    "This callback handles processing the uploaded file, selecting the model, applying the threshold, and displaying results dynamically.\n",
    "**Inputs**:\n",
    "- **Uploaded File**: Reads the content of the uploaded file in `.csv` format.\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Determines which predictive model will be used for identifying critical employees.\n",
    "- **Threshold Input**: Applies a percentage cutoff for identifying high-risk employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**:\n",
    "1. **Upload Feedback**:\n",
    "    - Communicates file processing results or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Critical Employee Table**:\n",
    "    - Displays the top 15 high-risk employees in a tabular format, including:\n",
    "        - Year, Month, Employee ID, Name, Position, Age, Status, and Turnover Probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload Status**:\n",
    "    - Summarizes the number of identified critical employees or errors during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. **File Loading**:\n",
    "    - Decodes and loads the uploaded dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "    - Temporarily saves the processed file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Validation and Loading**:\n",
    "    - Checks whether a valid model (e.g., `\"XGBoost\"`) is selected.\n",
    "    - Loads the chosen predictive model from the predefined directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Critical Employee Identification**:\n",
    "    - Processes the data and uses the model to calculate turnover probabilities for all employees.\n",
    "    - Filters the employees based on the given threshold to identify those at the highest risk of turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Results Display**:\n",
    "    - Returns the top 15 at-risk employees, formatted into a responsive Dash DataTable for easy analysis.\n",
    "    - Each column is styled for better readability (e.g., light blue header for emphasis).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "    - Catches and displays any errors encountered during file processing, model loading, or predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Critical Employee Processing**\n",
    "The `process_and_identify_critical_employees` function performs the core logic for identifying at-risk employees. Below is an overview of its workflow:\n",
    "**Step 1: Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "- **Dataset Loading and Cleaning**:\n",
    "    - Handles reading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Transformation**:\n",
    "    - Applies preprocessing steps, including scaling and encoding, for compatibility with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Model Loading**\n",
    "- Loads the predictive model (e.g., `\"XGBoost\"`) and associated feature names from the specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Model Predictions**\n",
    "- Applies the trained model to the preprocessed data to generate turnover probability scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Filtering Results**\n",
    "- Filters employees whose turnover probabilities exceed the threshold.\n",
    "- Ranks employees by risk and selects the top 15 candidates for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**:\n",
    "- A DataFrame containing all critical employees.\n",
    "- A filtered DataFrame with the top 15 employees by turnover probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features and Benefits**\n",
    "1. **Dynamic File Upload**:\n",
    "    - Ensures easy integration of custom datasets for personalized analysis.\n",
